## About: 
Welcome to my resume webpage! I'm Govind S Nair, a passionate coder with expertise in web development, data science, and more. This webpage was created by following a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjseP_Qhv4">video tutorial</a> by Bedimcode. It contains details on my education, experience, and certifications. I've also added links to my social profiles and mentioned contact details for easy reach. This page has been hosted using GitHub Pages, and you can find the link in the repository description.

## Features:
1. The use of CSS media queries allows a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile devices.
2. CSS custom properties (variables) are used to define colors, font sizes, font weights, and other styles.
3. The resume includes styles for a dark theme, enabling users to switch between light and dark modes easily.
4. The navigation menu collapses into a mobile-friendly version on smaller screens.
5. A scroll-to-top button that appears when the user scrolls down the page.
6. The CSS defines custom font styles using Google Fonts.
7. The CSS incorporates icon fonts or SVG icons for various elements like social media links, interests, skills, and more.
8. The resume includes detailed sections for education, work experience, skills, languages, and interests.
9. The webpage includes a "Generate PDF" button that enables users to download the resume as a PDF file.
